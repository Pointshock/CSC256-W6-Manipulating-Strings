This is a website that allows the user to enter 5 animals and it will display them in alphabetical order. For a greater UX, there is a clear buttton that clears the list leaving it blank. There is also a secret easter egg if the user enters the name of an animal with wings but can't fly. Hint: they also live in Antarctica.
